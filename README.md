## App UI Design

The final UI design can be seen in the following screenshot. Some UI components of the original design could not be detailed developed due to the low-quality screenshot from the video presentation available in Loom.

### Details about some widgets

* The central product list was developed to be horizontal scrollable, since the proposed UI was designed for wide-screen mobile devices, like tablets;
* The list of products is randomly generated by a repository layer. A UI controller returns the list of products to the screen;
* Each product can be selected from the list. A "check" icon will appear/desapear on/from the top right corner;
* I could not see the details of the Bottom Navigation Bar item. Therefore, I decided to use some items that seem closer to the original UI design.
